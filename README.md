# Distance Measure With Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) using two Arduino boards :
In this project, the circuit of an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor is created from scratch shown in the "HC-SR04 Circuit Design" image and then we program the inner microcontroller to Handle the recieve and transmit procedures. Eventually, the sensor is programmed by an outer microcontroller to measure the distance between the sensor and the obstacle. For the inner (Chinese OTP uController) and outer microcontrollers, an Arduino UNO and an ESP8266 boards are used respectively.
